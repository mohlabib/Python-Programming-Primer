    "\n",
    "Only when we know how the meaning of the sequence we can interpret it as\n",
    "for instance a part of an mp3 file, an image or a text. Therefore we\n",
    "have to provide to each data that we are using a *data type* in order to\n",
    "decode its meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means also that the same binary sequence can have different\n",
    "meanings depending on its interpretation. For example if we interprete\n",
    "the binary sequence as a positive integer it is interpreted as 38. Yet,\n",
    "if we interprete said sequence as an ASCII character (that is a\n",
    "standardized look-up table for typographic symbols, see for example\n",
    "[this reference](http://www.ascii-code.com/)) the binary sequence corresponds to the ampersand\n",

    "#### Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are whole numbers i.e. they have non fractional parts and can\n",

    "Python supports a lot of operations such as addition, subtraction,\n",
    "multiplication etc., on integers. The range of integers that can be\n",
    "handled by Python depends on the size (number of bits) of the reserved\n",
    "storage location. For example with an 8bit storage location you can only\n",
    "manage $2^8$ different integers which for unsigned integers only\n",
    "corresponds to the range 0\\...255.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Float\n",
    "\n",
    "Many numerical computations involve numbers having fractional parts.\n",
    "Such non-integer numbers such as 4.0, -0.09, 3.142 etc. are referred to\n",
    "as floating point numbers since the decimal point can move or 'float' to\n",
    "various positions within the number to maintain proper number of\n",
    "significant digits during mathematical calculations. Python supports the\n",
    "same numerical operations as in integers on floats. Floating point\n",
    "values are usually approximations of real numbers having limited range\n",
    "since each value must be stored in a fixed amount of memory. For\n",
    "instance, $\\pi$ is an irrational number that contains several digits in\n",
    "a non-uniform repeating pattern. Such values can only be approximated\n",
    "using the range of memory available for such data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object `sys.float_info` contains information on memories that\n",
    "floats occupy. Float values up to 1.7976931348623157e+308 and\n",
    "2.2250738585072014e-308 can be stored and processed by the computer.\n",
    "Values beyond these ranges will be truncated. In python 2, integer\n",
    "division truncates. This meant that evaluating 4/5 yields 0 as output\n",
    "since Python evaluates it as an integer division; thereby returning the\n",
    "least whole number which is 0. However, this has been corrected in\n",
    "python 3. The functions `float(n)` and `int(n)` can be used to convert\n",
    "any datatype to float and integer respectively."
