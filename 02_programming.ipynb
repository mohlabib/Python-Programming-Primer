    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "After processing this chapter you are able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - explain the basic programming concepts of case differentiation and\n",
    "    loops\n",
    "> - create proper scientific graphs\n",
    "> - use and create functions in Python\n",

    "The purpose of our last session was to obtain and install Python, get an\n",
    "overview of its graphical user interface and do some first steps.\n",
    "Admittedly we have used so far Python more as a fancy calculator rather\n",
    "than do any real programming with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time we will cover actual programming so that at the end of the\n",
    "session you are in principle able to solve most programming tasks. On\n",
    "the way we will get to know some more libraries that make our life a\n",
    "little more easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The very basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In some of the exercises from the last session we have already\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fundamental to programming that we are able to store values in a\n",
    "memory location for later use. Instead of specifying an address on a\n",
    "hard drive higher programming languages have introduced the concept of\n",
    "variables. Using variables the value of a specific memory location can\n",
    "be obtained by a name which is much easier to remember than a hard drive\n",
    "address. The assignment of an address to the variable name is done in\n",
    "the background and we can simply use the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist a few rules for variable names which you should consider\n",
    "(see also: [variables](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)). Variable names in python can be\n",
    "arbitrarily long but can only contain letters, numbers or the underscore\n",
    "symbol. The first character in a variable must be a letter or an\n",
    "underscore. It is however, recommended not to start the name of a\n",
    "variable with underscore. Note that variable names in Python do not have\n",
    "data types but the values they hold do. Giving a variable an illegal\n",
    "name, results in syntax error.\n",

    "Also make sure that your variable names are really unique and you do not\n",
    "use the same name twice by accident. This happens quite easily as for\n",
    "example `i` is a very common name for a counter variable. While you are\n",
    "free to name your variables however you want to, it is advisable to\n",
    "stick to some kind of coherent convention to make your code more easy to\n",
    "read (e.g. variable names always start with a lowercase letter).\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to many other programming languages, in Python we do not\n",
    "have to declare a variable and assign it a data type before it can be\n",
    "used. Instead we can just introduce a variable by assigning a value to\n",

    "##### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great advantages of using Python is that its community\n",
    "provides many libraries which contain often used functions such that the\n",
    "user does not have to program every tiny bit her/himself. You can\n",
    "recognize functions easily by a name immediately followed by parentheses\n",
    "which might contain a number of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "`functionname()` or `functionname(arg1, arg2, ..., argn)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be called by their name including the parantheses which\n",
    "(if applicable) contain values for the expected arguments. We have\n",
    "already used functions in the last session for example:\n",
    "`deg2rad(AngleFromZenith)`\n",
    "\n",
    "When using functions programmed by someone else (e.g. the Python\n",
    "developers) it is highly recommended to consult the documentation in\n",
    "order to learn what the function is doing exactly or what kind of\n",
    "arguments it expects. For example the function with the name `cos`\n",
    "expects that the argument is in radians and therefore does not interpret\n",
    "the argument 30 as degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important feature of functions is that they may return a value\n",
    "to the caller. Thus they can be used wherever a calculation, statement\n",
    "or value is expected as for example in the assignment as discussed\n",
    "above, they could even be nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a function from a library you must put the name of the\n",
    "library before the function name separated with a dot `.`. That way\n",
    "it is clear which function to use since different libraries may contain\n",
    "function with identical name but different functionality which will only\n",
    "lead to confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "AM=1/np.cos(np.deg2rad(AngleFromZenith))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions may not necessarily need arguments. We also do not necessarily\n",
    "need to use the return value at any point in the program. It is possible\n",
    "that there exist different functions of the same name but with a\n",
    "different number of arguments. This concept is called *overriding* and\n",
    "Python will automatically call the function which matches the data types\n",
    "of the arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that operations like addition, multiplication and such in\n",
    "principle are also just functions. The symbols +, -, etc. are called\n",
    "operators and are special symbols. The values upon which operators are\n",
    "applied, are referred to as operands. Python supports different\n",
    "operators ranging from simple mathematical operators to Bitwise and\n",
    "Boolean operators. Full documentation on operators and operands can be\n",
    "found [here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/operator.html#module-operator).\n",
    "\n",
    "For operators, the concept of overriding exists as well. For example, when\n",
    "using the `+` operator on complex numbers $a,b\\in \\mathbb{C}$ Python will\n",
    "automatically detect this and choose the addition for complex numbers.\n",
    "Later in this chapter you will get to know some more operators.\n",
    "\n",

    "### `while` - Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "This is accomplished via loops which in principle work as illustrated in\n",
    "the flow chart of Figure 2.1 and are implemented in Python via:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The program runs into a loop opening statement `while` which checks if a\n",
    "certain condition is fulfilled. In the case the condition evaluates to\n",
    "`True` the indented statements are performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here now one of the most characteristic features of the Python\n",
    "programming language becomes apparent. In other programming languages,\n",
    "the statements to be processed would be enclosed by the while statement\n",
    "and some ending statement or brackets. For readability, it has become\n",
    "standard to indent the statements within the loop. This standard has\n",
    "become so acknowledged, that in principle, closing the loop with an ending\n",
    "keyword has become obsolete as the indentation itself structures the\n",
    "logic of the program. In Python, the indentation is not only recommended,\n",
    "it is **required** and ending keywords are omitted making the code\n",
    "shorter and more easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a non-indented line is encountered, Python does not execute it but\n",
    "automatically returns to just before the loop opening statement to check\n",

    "evaluates to `False`, the loop stops and the program is continued with\n",
    "the non-indented line.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the consequence that somewhere within the loop statements the\n",
    "condition which is checked has to be modified in such a way that after\n",
    "some time it evaluates to `False`, otherwise the loop will never be\n",
    "stopped and the program be caught in an infinite loop. This is to be\n",
    "avoided as it can crash your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution of statements within one repetition of the loop can be\n",
    "prematurely aborted with the keyword `continue`. When the program\n",
    "encounters this keyword, the program jumps immediately to the position\n",
    "just before the loop opening to check the loop condition again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussed loop structure is called a `while` loop, and in principle\n",
    "is sufficient for all programming tasks. Yet, there exist certain\n",
    "variations to loops which occur so frequently that there exist special\n",
    "keywords which are more intuitive and more easy to program.\n",

    "Loops can be nested which is for example necessary to process data\n",
    "tables of dimension larger than 1 (e.g. matrices).\n",

    "\n",
    "Maybe you have already realized that there is something wrong with the\n",
    "calculation of the Azimuth. According to [PVEducation (azimuth)](https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/azimuth-angle), the azimuth\n",
    "(Azimuth Angle) is defined with $\\psi=0$ when the sun is due North\n",
    "increasing into the direction of the East ($\\psi=90$), passing the South\n",
    "($\\psi=180$) and returning via the West ($\\psi=270$). Thus we would\n",
    "expect the azimuth to be monotonously increasing over time. Instead our\n",
    "plot in Figure 2.2 rather suggests that the sun suddenly changes\n",
    "its direction. This is obviously not plausible, so what happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "We obtained the formula $\\psi(\\delta,\\varphi,\\alpha, HRA)$ for the\n",
    "azimuth from [PVEducation (sun_position)](https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/the-suns-position). Yet, at the very bottom of [PVEducation (azimuth)](https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/azimuth-angle) it is explained that this equation is in fact only\n",
    "correct in the morning and that it has to be modified under certain\n",
    "conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    Azimuth &= \\psi(\\delta,\\varphi,\\alpha, HRA) & \\text{for } LST < 12 \\text{ or } HRA < 0 \\\\\n",
    "    Azimuth &= 360^{\\circ} - \\psi(\\delta,\\varphi,\\alpha, HRA) & \\text{for } LST > 12 \\text{ or } HRA > 0 \n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact this would only be correct for a certain day in solar time $0 < LST < 24$. As we want to observe the azimuth on a local day we have to add another case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "Azimuth &= -\\psi(\\delta,\\varphi,\\alpha, HRA) & \\text{for } LST < 0 \\text{ and } HRA < 0 \n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we conclude that we need to treat different parts of the\n",
    "calculation in distinct ways in order to obtain plausible results. The\n",
    "different calculations are called *cases* and are executed when certain\n",
    "*conditions* are fulfilled which have to be checked beforehand.\n",

    "\n",
    "The program runs into the `if` statement. In the case the statement in\n",
    "the check condition evaluates to the logical value `True` the indented\n",
    "statements below are executed until the next non-indented line is\n",
    "encountered. Similarly to loops no ending statement is required as in\n",
    "other programming languages since the logical structure is given by the\n",
    "indentation. If the condition evaluates to `False` the statements are\n",
    "skipped and the program is directly continued with the first\n",
    "non-indented line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The check condition may be a logical value, the return value of a\n",
    "function, a comparison operation or a logical combination of all of the\n",
    "mentioned:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "if (a>11.1 and a<14.4):\n",

    "programming needs often we will be in a situation where we do not want\n",

    "chart in Figure 2.4 this is represented as two branching paths\n",
